  <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>


<br/>
Russian roulette is a lethal game of chance in which a player places a single round in a revolver, spins the cylinder, places the muzzle against the head or body (of the opponent or themselves), and pulls the trigger. If the loaded chamber aligns with the barrel, the weapon will fire, killing or severely injuring the player. In this project, we aim to imitate a game based on it using concepts of game theory and applying it using Python.

## HOW THE GAME WORKS

<br/>
A total of 6 bullets will be loaded into the barrel of a revolver and it is upto the player to decide weather or not if he wants to shoot himself or the dealer. Out of the 6 bullets 3 are live bullets (actual bullets) and 3 dud bullets (fake bullets) and a total of 3 lives each are given to both the player and the dealer. You have the choice of either shooting yourself or shooting the dealer. The actual bullets take 1 life of the target while the dud bullet does nothing. If the player or the dealer shoots himself and the bullets appears to be a dud his turn will still continue while if you shoot someone and the bullet is found out to be a dud your turn ends.
